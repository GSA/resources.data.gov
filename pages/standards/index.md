# Overview

This data standards repository website is provided to accelerate the creation and adoption of data standards across federal agencies. Here you can find information about different types of existing standards of all types (e.g., metadata, content, classification), including policies related to using voluntary consensus standards, information about standards-developing organizations and communities of practices inside and outside of government, and a catalog of data standards already in use by the Federal Government. 

In order to better understand the various resources and data standards included here, the [concepts and definitions page](./concepts/) helps establish basic terms for data standards, their component parts, and broader frameworks and initiatives that are used for constructing more extensive or cross-disciplinary data standards. 

This repository was initially established through [Action 20 of the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan](https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/#action-20-develop-a-data-standards-repository) and is managed jointly by the Office of Management and Budget and the GSA following the [governance process](../about/governance/) defined for resources.data.gov. You are welcome to provide feedback and suggest content changes via [Github](https://github.com/GSA/resources.data.gov/issues/157) or by emailing [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov)
