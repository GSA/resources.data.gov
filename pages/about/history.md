The [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (“Evidence Act”)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text) signed into law on January 14, 2019, emphasizes collaboration and coordination to advance data and evidence-building functions in the Federal Government by statutorily mandating Federal evidence-building activities, open government data, and confidential information protection and statistical efficiency. Title II of the Foundations for Evidence Based Policymaking Act, the OPEN Government Data Act,requires the Office of Management and Budget to collaborate with the Office of Government Information Services and the Administrator of General Services to develop and maintain an online repository of tools, best practices, and schema standards to facilitate the adoption of open data practices across the Federal Government.

The [Evidence Act Orientation]({{ site.baseurl }}/orientation/) was hosted in September 2019 for all designated officials. 

Beyond open data, [Resources.data.gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/) serves as the central repository for Federal Enterprise Data resources including tools, case studies, playbooks, and guidance on how to manage and use Federal data. Provide feedback and check back often as Resources.data.gov continues to be updated.
