# Enterprise data resources

Resources.data.gov is an effort by the Office of Management and Budget, the
Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives, and the
General Services Administration to provide an online repository of guidance and
tools to implement the OPEN Government Data Act.

While the site is required by the OPEN Government Data Act,
[resources.data.gov](https://resources.data.gov/) serves a broader purpose as
the central repository for Federal Enterprise Data resources including tools,
case studies, playbooks, and guidance on how to manage and use Federal data. The
repository will be frequently updated with additional tools and resources and
will be developed in an open, collaborative manner and will welcome suggestions
from the public.
