description: The NOAA Big Data Project (BDP) was created to explore the potential benefits of storing copies of key observations and model outputs in the Cloud to allow computing directly on the data without requiring further distribution. Such an approach helps form new lines of business and economic growth while making NOAA's data more accessible to the public.
