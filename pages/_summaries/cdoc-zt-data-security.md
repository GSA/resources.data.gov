resource_name: CDO Council and CISO Council Joint Guide on Federal Zero Trust Data Security
description: "In May 2025, the CDO Council and the CISO Council released the
  latest Federal Zero Trust (ZT) Data Security Guide, a first-of-its-kind
  document and key deliverable of OMB M-22-09, moving the U.S. Government
  Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles. M-22-09 charged the Federal CDO
  Council and Federal CISO Council to convene a cross-agency working group of
  data and security experts to develop a data security guide for Federal
  agencies. More than 30 Federal agencies and departments answered the call to
  author this guide to assist practitioners in operationalizing data security
  using a ZT framework."
