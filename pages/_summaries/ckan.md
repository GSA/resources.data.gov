description: Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) is a powerful open source
  data management system that makes data accessible by providing tools to streamline
  publishing, sharing, finding and using data. The Data.gov catalog is based on CKAN,
  a technology that powers many government open data sites. Inventory.data.gov is
  a separate instance of CKAN hosted at GSA on the same infrastructure as the Data.gov
  catalog.
