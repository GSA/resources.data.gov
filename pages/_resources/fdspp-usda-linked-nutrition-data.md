description: Purchase-to-Plate Crosswalk (PPC) links the more than 359,000 food products
  in a comercial company database to several thousand foods in a series of USDA nutrition
  databases. By linking existing data resources, USDA was able to enrich and expand
  the analysis capabilities of both datasets. Since there were no common identifiers
  between the two data structures, the team used probabilistic and semantic methods
  to reduce the manual effort required to link the data.
