description: "The U.S. Department of Labor sought to go beyond merely making data\
  \ available to developers and take ease of use of the data to the next level by\
  \ giving developers tools that would make using DOL\u2019s data easier.  DOL created\
  \ software development kits (SDKs), which are downloadable code packages that developers\
  \ can drop into their apps, making access to DOL\u2019s data easy for even the most\
  \ novice developer. These SDKs have even been published as open source projects\
  \ with the aim of speeding up their conversion to SDKs that will eventually support\
  \ all federal APIs."
