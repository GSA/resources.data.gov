description: "Although not a true pause in operations, ONR\u2019s data standdown made\
  \ data quality and data consolidation the top priority for the entire organization.\
  \ It aimed to establish an automated and repeatable solution to enable a more holistic\
  \ view of ONR investments and activities, and to increase transparency and effectiveness\
  \ throughout its mission support functions. In addition, it demonstrated that getting\
  \ top-level buy-in from management to prioritize data can truly advance a more data-driven\
  \ culture."
