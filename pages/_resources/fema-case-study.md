description: "In 2008, the Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP), an E-Government\
  \ initiative led by FEMA with support from 16 U.S. Government partners, launched\
  \ DisasterAssistance.gov to simplify the process for disaster survivors to identify\
  \ and apply for disaster assistance. DAIP utilized existing partner technologies\
  \ and implemented a services oriented architecture (SOA) that integrated the content\
  \ management system and rules engine supporting Department of Labor\u2019s Benefits.gov\
  \ applications with FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance Center application. The FEMA\
  \ SOA serves as the backbone for data sharing interfaces with three of DAIP\u2019\
  s federal partners and transfers application data to reduce duplicate data entry\
  \ by disaster survivors. "
