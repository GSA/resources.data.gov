description: ReVAL (Reusable Validation & Aggregation Library) is a Django App for
  validating and aggregating data via API and web interface.
details: USDA FNS uses ReVAL to implement their Data Validation Service tool for validating
  data from FNS-742 form submissions.  Each year state agencies report these data
  for each School Food Authority (SFA) with schools operating the National School
  Lunch Programs (NSLP) and/or the School Breakfast Program (SBP).<br/><br/>The Census
  Bureau uses ReVAL to explore an implementation to check Commodity Flow Survey (CFS)
  Data.  These CFS data are used by policy makers and transportation planners in various
  federal, state, and local agencies for assessing the demand for transportation facilities
  and services, energy use, and safety risk and environmental concerns.<br/><br/>The
  Department of Transportation uses ReVAL to validate Work Zone Data by validating
  it against the Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification.  The Work Zone Data
  Exchange (WZDx) Specification enables infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs)
  to make harmonized work zone data available for third party use. The intent is to
  make travel on public roads safer and more efficient through ubiquitous access to
  data on work zone activity. Specifically, the project aims to get data on work zones
  into vehicles to help automated driving systems (ADS) and human drivers navigate
  more safely.
